00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
We're on campus — here's a quick
snapshot.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,667
of Syracuse Women’s Lacrosse in 2024.
Big picture — what stands out?

3
00:00:11,667 --> 00:00:19,333
The team increased shot volume, averaging
about fifty-five shots per game,

4
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:23,333
but shooting efficiency fell. Goals per
game nudged up slightly

5
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:25,000
while assists per game dropped.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Who led the scoring in 2024? Emma Tyrrell
led the team —

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,667
sixty-one goals and thirty-one assists.

8
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:39,000
Any big year-over-year improvements? Yes —
Payton Rowley had the

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
biggest jump, a plus thirty-six increase.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:51,000
What worrying trends should the coach fix?
Turnovers rose — they’re

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
up to about twenty-six point six per game.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Final coaching takeaway: Keep the
aggressive tempo,

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
but train shot selection and
decision-making.
